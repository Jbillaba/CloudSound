 # Technologies used 
 ## (Back-End) Django takes care of the relations while AWS S3 takes care of the media files (pretty much is stored there is pulled through an axios call) 
 ## (Front-End) For the audio player I used a npm package called react h5 audio player, I used State to pass the song audio file into the player.
